## Sudoku_detector.py
To be accurate, this program detects the objects with 4 sides (not exclusively sudoku). But sudoku table also has 4 sides, doesn't it? :)   

To run the program prepare a sample image and execute the line:  
```shell
python sudoku_detector.py --input *sample_image* 
```
Forexample if we provide it with the image I used in the notebook file (sudoku_detector.ipynb) the following result will be produced

and if you press the button 's', a screenshot of the detected object will be captured.
